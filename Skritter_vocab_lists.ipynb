    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "[Skritter](https://skritter.com/) is a very sophisticated piece of software which can be used to learn both Chinese and Japanese. It is software which uses spaced repetition allowing one to learn Chinese and Japanese characters at the stroke level. It is more advanced than say Anki, but it requires a subscription to use it. Skritter has a number of useful vocabulary lists on their website including many popular textbooks. Many of these lists are available elsewhere on the internet, but some can be difficult to locate. It is possible to export these lists from Skritter, but this is cumbersome if you want more than one list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a relatively simple notebook written to practice web scraping using [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/). It will log in to your Skritter account and scrape vocabulary lists. In order to get these lists you will need to sign up for an account with Skritter. The purpose of this script is to make life a little easier for Chinese and Japanese language learners. This notebook will scrape vocabulary lists into csv files and produce a description of each list in a markdown file. However, there is no audio scraped or character stroke information from Skritter to accompany these lists. The format of the csv files makes it easy to use with other software such as Anki. The format for the columns is\n",
    "    1. Simplified Chinese\n",
    "    2. Traditional Chinese if different from simplified Chinese, otherwise it is just a dash (-)\n",
    "    3. Pinyin \n",
    "    4. English \n",
    "    5. Tag (Section)\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, one could of accomplished the same task by copying, pasting and editing or using the export features available on Skritter to reach the same outcome, but by automating this task using Selenium will hopefully make life a whole lot easier for you, especially if you decide you want more than one vocabulary list. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this to obtain a few of the Chinese lists, but this notebook will also get Japanese lists too, if desired. However, please note that if you are getting Japanese lists there are still 5 columns in the csv files\n",
    "    1. Writing = Kanji/Hiragana/Katakana\n",
    "    2. Writing enabled = Who knows? This is still scraped and put into the csv files. Easily removed if desired.\n",
    "    3. Reading = Hiragana/Katakana\n",
    "    4. Definition = English \n",
    "    5. Tag (Section)\n",
    " \n",
    "The functions are rather simple and could possibly be improved upon. Also note that there is very simple error handling included here. A good webscraper should of course try to anticipate as many errors possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Skritter provides a valuable service and if you use their materials you should have a subscription and download only the lists you intend to study. This script was intended to automate and simplify what you can already do on their website.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTES:\n",
    "I have used Selenium with the Chrome browser. You will need to:\n",
    "- Install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)\n",
    "- Check the version of Chrome, then get the corresponding *chromedriver* from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).\n",
    "- Unzip *chromedriver*\n",
    "- Put it somewhere sensible. Since I am using a Mac I have moved it to `/usr/local/bin` by \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is **NOT** recommended that you try to download all lists for a particular language all at once. This can take a very long time and may over burden their server. Rather you should only select a few at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "### TODO:\n",
    "- Improve exception handling. At the moment only minimal exeception handling has been included. \n"
